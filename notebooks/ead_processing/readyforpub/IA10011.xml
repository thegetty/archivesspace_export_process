         <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
         <p>These records comprise press releases, press kits, event calendars, magazines, reports, recordings, and advertisements. Records were created and published by the J. Paul Getty Museum and the J. Paul Getty Trust and date from 1954 to 1959 and 1973 to 2022 (bulk 1983-2022). The collection includes original, photocopied, and digital (.pdf, .mht, .mhtml, and MP3) files. The materials, intended to publicize Getty events and activities to the media and the public, were disseminated by the J. Paul Getty Museum (1954-1982), the Department of Public Affairs (1983-1999), and the Communications Department (2000-present). The organization issued relatively few press releases until the construction of the Villa Museum in 1974, and it is uncertain if any exist from 1960 to 1972. An increase in press release production came in the early 1980s with the expansion of the trust and its operations.</p>
         <p>Subjects include acquisitions; administration; awards, including Getty Medal recipients; building projects; collaborative projects; cultural property conservation and restoration; exhibitions; grant awards; logistical advisories; organizational initiatives; publication announcements; public and scholarly events; senior personnel and board of trustees appointments; and others. Of note are the J. Paul Getty Museum 1954 opening press release, transcriptions of news articles regarding the opening that were published in local media outlets, opening day remarks, and event flow for the opening day reception; and various press kits documenting the building of the Getty Center in Brentwood, including site and architect selection, center design, construction, and the 1997 opening. All Getty programs, including those no longer in operation, are represented.</p>
         <p>While the number of materials in this collection is extensive, it is not presumed that they are comprehensive for any given subject or year, excepting digital press releases dating 2016 to 2022. </p>

         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>
The J. Paul Getty Trust's origins date to 1953, when J. Paul Getty established the J. Paul Getty Museum as a California charitable trust to house his growing art collections. Originally a small, private institution located in Mr. Getty's ranch house near Malibu, the museum moved to the newly constructed Villa in grounds adjacent to the ranch house in 1974. When most of Mr. Getty's personal estate passed to the trust in 1982, the trustees decided that given the size of the endowment, it should make a greater contribution to the visual arts and humanities than the museum could alone. Out of this resolve grew an expanded commitment to the arts in the general areas of scholarship, conservation, and education. This took the shape of new programs including the Center for the History of Art and Humanities (GCHAH), Art History Information Institute (AHIP), Conservation Institute, Grant Program, and Center for Education in the Arts (GCEA). Smaller programs include the Museum Management Institute (MMI), a joint venture with the Art Museum Association of America, and the Program for Art on Film, a joint venture with the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1983 the trust's corporate name was changed from the J. Paul Getty Museum to the J. Paul Getty Trust to reflect its broader scope, with the museum becoming an operating program of the trust. On December 16, 1997 the Getty Center, a new unified facility housing all Getty programs, was opened in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA.</p>
         <p>As the trust matured several of the programs underwent administrative and functional reorganizations resulting in name changes or dissolutions. AHIP's name was changed to the Getty Information Institute (GII) in 1996 as part of a new identity program instituted by the Trust just prior to occupancy of their new unified facility.  To avoid confusion with the soon-to-open Getty Center in Brentwood, GCHAH was renamed the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities in 1996. Three years later the program's name was shortened to the Getty Research Institute (GRI). The GII was dissolved in 1999 and many of its functions were absorbed by the Getty Research Institute (GRI). The Getty Center for Education in the Arts (GCEA) changed its name to the Getty Education Institute for the Arts (GEI) in 1996, and was disbanded in 1998. In 1996, Program for Art on Film was transferred to the Pratt Institute and the Trust ended its affiliation with the program. The Getty Leadership Institute (GLI) was created in 1996 to administer museum executive education programs, including the Museum Management Institute (MMI). Administration of GLI programs was transferred to the Claremont Graduate University in 2010. The Grant Program changed its name to the Foundation in January 2005.</p>
         <p>J. Paul Getty Museum press material was prepared and distributed by Museum curator Paul Wescher from 1954-1959. Press release production was not officially institutionalized until 1974 with the creation of the Public Information department and the appointment of Deborah Ashin as Public Affairs Director, although some press releases are dated from 1973. From 1979 to 1997 museum press releases were consistently rendered from Public Information, and in 1983 the Department of Public Affairs was created to issue press releases on behalf of the J. Paul Getty Trust and its non-museum programs. The Department of Public Affairs reported directly to trust leadership, whereas Public Information reported to the museum. In 1998 the Department of Public Affairs began issuing press releases on behalf of the museum and responsibility for the organization's press release function was placed in a single department. The Department of Public Affairs name was changed to Communications in 2000. With the hiring of Pamela Johnson in August 2002, the department head role was elevated to the level of Vice President, reporting to the President and CEO. </p>
         <p>Although the Communications department had been creating digital (.pdf files) press releases for some time, systematic annual collection of the materials by Institutional Archives began in 2015. </p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>These press releases in hardcopy and digital format document events that the J. Paul Getty Trust wished to publicize to media outlets and date from 1954 to 1959 and 1973 to 2022. The press releases, intended to promote Getty activities, were distributed to journalists and other members of the media by the J. Paul Getty Museum (1954-1982), the Department of Public Affairs (1983-1999), and the Communications Department (2000-present). Also present are media advisories, event calendars, and memos. Of note are the J. Paul Getty Museum 1954 opening press release, transcriptions of news articles regarding the opening that were published in local media outlets, opening day remarks, and event flow for the opening day reception. </p>
               <p>Topics include acquisitions; administration; awards, including Getty Medal recipients; building projects; collaborative projects; cultural property conservation and restoration; exhibitions; grant awards; logistical advisories; organizational initiatives; publication announcements; public and scholarly events; senior personnel and board of trustees appointments; and others. All Getty programs, including those no longer in operation, are represented. It is uncertain if any press releases exist from 1960 to 1972. </p>
               <p>A portion of press releases dating 2000-2006 were received in digital (.pdf) format; hardcopy duplicates may also be present. Starting in 2014 press releases were received in exclusively digital format; 2014-2021 press releases appear as .pdf files, and 2022 press releases appear in .mhtml format. Duplicate press releases may also appear in Series II. Press releases, subject files and Series III. Press kits. </p>
               <p>While the number of press releases is extensive, it is not presumed to be a comprehensive collection, except from 2016 to 2022.</p>

               <p>The records are arranged into three sections: J. Paul Getty Museum, J. Paul Getty Trust, and J. Paul Getty Trust, digital materials. Records are arranged in chronological order, and chronological order by program.</p>
               <p>Press releases dating 1954-1959, 1973-2004, and a partial set dating 2005-2006 have been digitally scanned to a repository for access. None of the records dating 2007-2008 have been scanned. Links to access copies appear beneath the folder titles in the inventory.</p>
               <p>Digital press releases materials originating from the J. Paul Getty Trust, 2000-2022 are arranged in chronological order by program. Digital preservation requirements necessitate the bundling and processing of records by accession, so records are displayed in sets according to accession number and are not necessarily in strict chronological order. As a result date ranges prior to 2016 may be duplicated in the inventory headings instead of integrated under a single heading. Records dated 2016 and after are inventoried exclusively for that year. Note that some records may duplicate those found in the paper records press materials in this series, and in Series II. Press releases, subject files and Series III. Press kits.</p>

               <head>Digitized versions</head>
               <p>Final versions of hard-copy press releases issued by the Getty from 1954-1959 and 1973-2006  have been scanned, processed using uncorrected optical character recognition (OCR), and saved as .pdf-a files. The contents of each folder have been scanned as a single .pdf; depending on the contents of the folder each pdf may be a single press release or multiple releases. The links to these electronic versions appear beneath the folder titles in the inventory. Internal word-searchabiltiy of the .pdf files varies depending on the consistency of the font and on the quality and background color of the original release. Please note that all material in the folders that was not a final Getty-issued press release was not scanned,including drafts, memos, correspondence, photos, and releases issued by other organizations.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>These press releases document events that the J. Paul Getty Trust wished to publicize to media outlets, and date from 1974 to 2002. The press releases, intended to promote Getty activities, were distributed to journalists and other members of the media by the J. Paul Getty Museum (1954-1982), the Department of Public Affairs (1983-1999), and the Communications Department (2000-present). Also present are media advisories, event calendars and fact sheets with associated press clippings and memorandums.</p>
               <p>Topics include acquisitions; appointments, awards, and resignations; building projects; conferences and projects; conservation and restoration; docents and volunteers; exhibitions; fellows, scholars, and interns; grant awards; operational announcements; performances and events; panels, seminars, and symposiums; publications; and others. All Getty programs, including those no longer in operation, are represented. Duplicate press releases may also appear in Series I. Chronological press releases, and Series III. Press kits.  While the number of press releases is extensive, it is not presumed to be a comprehensive collection.</p>

               <head>Organization</head>
               <p>The records are arranged by program and then by subject. The programs appear in the following order: Trust, Museum, Getty Conservation Institute, Center for the History of Art in the Humanities/Getty Research Institute, Center for Education in the Arts/Getty Education Institute (including the Art on Film, Museum Management Institute, and Leadership Institute programs), Art History Information Program/Getty Information Institute, and the Getty Grant Program.</p>
               <p>Within each subject area, the records are listed in reverse chronological order. If a listed program has been dissolved into another, every intention has been made to retain both program headings and keep the continuous chronology intact. Please note that some records in this series duplicate those found in Series I: Chronological files.</p>

               <head>Digitized versions</head>
               <p>The majority of final versions of hard-copy press releases issued by the Getty 1974-2002 have been scanned, processed using uncorrected optical character recognition (OCR), and saved as .pdf-a files. The content of each folder has been scanned as a single .pdf; depending on the contents of the folder each .pdf may be a single press release or multiple releases. The links to these electronic versions appear beneath the folder titles in the Series II inventory for the years 1974-2002; some records predating 2002 have not been scanned, nor records from 2006. Internal word-searchabiltiy of the .pdf files varies depending on the consistency of the font and on the quality and background color of the original release. Please note that all material in the folders that was not a final Getty-issued press release was not scanned, including drafts, memos, correspondence, photos, and releases issued by other organizations.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>These press kits document events that the J. Paul Getty Museum and the J. Paul Getty Trust wished to publicize to media outlets, and date from 1954, 1973, 1983 to 1984, and 1989 to 2018. The press kits were distributed to journalists and other members of the media by the J. Paul Getty Museum (1954-1982), the Department of Public Affairs (1983-1999), and the Communications Department (2000-present) at exhibition openings, press conferences, and other events organized to promote Getty activities. The press kits were also distributed upon request. Although the kits contain press releases that may be found in Series I. Chronological press releases and Series II. Press releases, subject files, these records are unique in that they comprise illustrated folders containing complete sets of publicity documentation for exhibitions or events that include fact sheets, images approved for reproduction in third-party publications, exhibition object lists, lists of related publications, public events, and other information.</p>
               <p>While the majority of the press kits concern exhibitions, topics also include acquisitions; collaborative initiatives, including Pacific Standard Time (PST) 2014 and 2018; conferences; conservation initiatives; buildings and grounds; general kits providing information about the Getty Center and its programs; theater productions; and the tenth and twentieth anniversaries of the Brentwood Getty Center. Of note are the press kits for the original 1954 opening of the J. Paul Getty Museum located in Mr. Getty's Ranch House, and various kits documenting the building of the Getty Center in Brentwood, including site and architect selection, center design, construction, and the 1997 opening. All Getty programs, including those no longer in operation, are represented.</p>
               <p>Two kits for each event have been collected when possible. While the number of press kits is extensive, it is not presumed to be a comprehensive collection.</p>

               <p>These calendars in hardcopy and digital format document the public events that took place at the J. Paul Getty Museum (Malibu) and the Getty Center and date from 1975 to 2022. The calendars intend to periodically inform the general public about exhibitions, performances, tours, courses, and other happenings, and provide dates, times and other details about how to attend. The name of the calendar has been periodically changed over time, and these titles are reflected in the inventory headings. Calendars published in press release format, and intended for media editors, are located in Series I. Chronological press releases.</p>
               <p>Around 2017 the calendars began to be published in digital format to complement any existing hardcopy versions. The digital calendars are web documents originally published as .html files, and captured here as .mht and .mhtml files. The calendars contain links to the Getty web site which were functional at the time of capture.</p>
               <p>While the number of calendars is extensive, it does not presumed to be a comprehensive collection.</p>

               <p>These magazines document current events, subjects, and topics about the Getty and its programs, and date from 1986 to 1997 and 2012 to 2022. The magazines are written for a general interest audience and are intended to inform and update the public on the activities of the Getty. The name of the magazine has been periodically changed over time, and these titles are reflected in the inventory headings. The collection does not presume to be comprehensive.</p>
               <p>The Getty Magazine is also published in digital (.pdf) format. Some digital versions are included in this inventory.</p>
               <p>The Year in Review was first published as a web page, and captured in this inventory as .mht and .mhtml files, in fiscal year 2019. Links embedded in the web page were functional at the time of capture. The Year In Review replaces the non-financial front-matter sections previously published in the J. Paul Getty Trust Annual Report (which ceased publication after FY2018.) J. Paul Getty Trust Annual Reports published prior to FY2019 appear in IA30020, J. Paul Getty Museum and J. Paul Getty Trust Accounting and Finance records.</p>
               <p>The recordings document Getty public relations events presented by Communications staff and date from 2016 to 2017. Intended to promote public awareness of the Getty and its activities to specific groups, the recordings include press previews, press conferences, and speeches given to invited audiences.</p>
