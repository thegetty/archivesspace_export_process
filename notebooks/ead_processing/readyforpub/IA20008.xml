         <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
         <p>Records consist of correspondence, letters, press releases, clippings, articles, memos, notes, reports, photographs, films, magazines, journals, CD-ROMs, audio cassettes, slides, financial documents, legal documents, curriculum vitae, catalogs, brochures, inventories, books, posters, minutes, surveys, and transcripts created and collected by the Program for Art on Film, 1951-1999 and undated. Included in the collection are records created by the Program for Art on Film (publications and films), and a large collection of records collected by the Program.</p>
         <p>The records created by the Program describe the development, production, promotion and distribution of Art on Film projects. The Program for Art on Film produced a number of reference works that are included or mentioned in the records, such as the Art on Film Database, begun in 1984; <emph render="italic">Art on Screen: A Directory of Films and Videos about the Visual Arts</emph> (G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 1992); <emph render="italic">Art Museums and Media</emph> (1994); and <emph render="italic">The Art on Screen Handbook: Practical Guidelines for Using and Producing Films, Videos and Interactive Programs about Art</emph> (1994). The Program's Production Laboratory produced 14 films for its <emph render="bold">Art on Film/Film on Art</emph> series, many of which received awards and all of which are described and included in the records. Among the filmmakers, artists and art historians who collaborated on some of these films are Philip Haas, David Hockney and Ernst Gombrich. The records also describe the day-to-day administrative management of the Program through strategic planning reports and advisory and managing committee meeting minutes, information on the Program's joint ventures with the J. Paul Getty Trust, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Columbia University and Pratt Institute. The Program's work on symposia, conferences, and educational outreach activities is documented in the records describing Art on Screen and Architecture on Screen, Art on Film, and screenings of its films. The activities of the Production Laboratory are also documented in the records, and can be found throughout all the subseries.</p>
         <p>The records also include materials collected by the Program, such as informational materials (in the form of press releases, brochures and catalogs) on national and international companies and organizations that produce and distribute films on art; individual films (both feature and documentary) that take as subject artists or art; and conferences that screen films on art. The "people files" document filmmakers, art historians, and other individuals with interest in film and/or the arts; some of the individuals represented in the records served as evaluators for the Program's publications (including its films). The Program collected a variety of material on national and international film festivals that screen films about art; these are represented in the records primarily by brochures and catalogs. The "subject files" represent material used for research. These records primarily describe artists, films, organizations, art historical time periods and movements. Lastly, the Program collected posters for films (both art and non-art related); these are included in the records.</p>

         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>The Program for Art on Film was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a pilot project that would eventually become independent from its founding institutions. The Program's purpose was to define issues, develop programs, and disseminate information that would support the effective production and use of moving-image media that contribute to a better understanding and appreciation of the visual arts.</p>
         <p>From 1984, the Getty Trust, through a joint venture with the Metropolitan Museum, subsidized the development of the Art on Screen Database and the Program's other projects. The Trust's support made it possible for the Program to offer a range of services to the field for free or at minimal cost during this productive development period under the joint venture, which concluded in June of 1994. From July 1994 through June 1996, the Program was based at Columbia University.</p>
         <p>The Program was then established as an independent, non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation. In 1996 the Program affiliated with the Pratt Institute and moved its offices to the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) building, on the Institute's main campus in Brooklyn, New York. Some of the resulting programs enabled by this new joint venture were the Art on Screen and Architecture on Screen festivals.</p>
         <p>The Program's first Executive Director was Karl Katz (1984-1992). Wendy Stein served as Program Manager and Nadine Covert served as Special Consultant, Critical Inventory during the same period. In 1992, Covert was named Manager of the Program. Joan Shigekawa served as Coordinator, Production Laboratory, from 1986 to 1990. When the Program moved to Columbia University in 1994, Covert was named Director, and served in this position until 1998, when the program was discontinued.</p>
         <p>During its lifetime, the Program's activities included a constellation of complementary services: compiling and maintaining the Art on Screen Database (also known as the Critical Inventory); publishing <emph render="italic">Art on Screen</emph>, the newsletter of film and video on the visual arts; developing filmographies, handbooks, and other publications; reviewing and evaluating moving-image productions on art and architecture; presenting workshops and seminars for educators and museum professionals; and distributing a series of short films and videos involving collaborations between art scholars and filmmakers, produced as part of the Program's earlier Production Laboratory experiment.</p>
         <p>Among the reference works produced by the Program were: the Art on Film Database, begun in 1984; <emph render="italic">Films and Videos on Photography</emph>, in collaboration with the Direction des Musées de France, Ministry of Culture and Communication, Paris, in both English and French editions; <emph render="italic">Art on Screen: A Directory of Films and Videos about the Visual Arts</emph> (G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 1992); <emph render="italic">Art on Screen</emph>, a newsletter of the visual arts, and <emph render="italic">Close-Ups</emph>, the Art on Film Database Service supplement of reviews and recommended film titles; <emph render="italic">Architecture on Screen</emph> (G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 1994); <emph render="italic">Art Museums and Media</emph> (1994), a report of survey results; and <emph render="italic">The Art on Screen Handbook: Practical Guidelines for Using and Producing Films, Videos and Interactive Programs about Art</emph> (1994).</p>
         <p>The Art on Screen Database provided a unique critical inventory of more than 26,000 international film, video, and multimedia productions. The scope of the database included fine arts, architecture, photography, archaeology, decorative arts, design, costume, crafts, folk arts, and related topics such as aesthetics and creativity. The database was ranked among the top three databases by the Consortium of College and University Media Centers. It appeared in electronic form in 1995 as <emph render="italic">Art on Screen on CD-ROM</emph> (G.K. Hall/Macmillan). [Adapted from Nadine Covert, "Milestones: Activities and Accomplishments"]</p>

               <p>Records consist of correspondence, letters, public relations material, clippings, reports, photographs, films, financial documents, legal documents, published material, minutes, surveys, transcripts, and audiocassettes created, published and collected by the Program for Art on Film and its Production Laboratory, 1971-1999. The records describe the development, production, promotion and distribution of Program for Art on Film projects (handbooks, newsletters, databases, and films).</p>
               <p>The records describe the day-to-day administrative management of the Program for Art on Film through strategic planning reports, advisory and managing committee meeting minutes, and information on the Program's various joint ventures (with the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the J. Paul Getty Trust, Columbia University, and the Pratt Institute). The records also describe specific Program for Art on Film projects and publications, such as handbooks and newsletters, databases, reports and resource guides, and various other programs and projects. Among the most visible of the Program's projects were the 14 films created by its Production Laboratory for its <emph render="bold">Art on Film/Film on Art</emph> series, many of which received awards. The Program's work on symposia, conferences, and educational outreach activities is documented in the records describing Art on Screen and Architecture on Screen (that also resulted in publications of the same name), Art on Film, and screenings of its films that took place around the world. The activities of the Production Laboratory are also documented in the records, and can be found throughout all of the subseries.</p>

                  <p>Records comprise correspondence, memoranda, notes, database definitions, web page printouts, database printouts, csv and xls copies of the data, and a clipping, dated 1994-1998, created by the Program for Art on Film in the course of developing their website and, in particular, the Art on Screen database and its public interface.</p>
                  <p>Most of the films documented in the Art on Screen database were produced between 1970 and 1998, with selective coverage of productions from 1915 to 1969. Each of the roughly 26,000 citations includes a synopsis, credits, country, language, production date, format, and other filmographic data. The last addition to the database was made in 1998. The database includes productions from more than 70 countries. Subjects covered include fine arts (painting, sculpture, drawing), architecture, archaeology, photography, decorative arts, design, costume, crafts, folk arts, and related topics such as aesthetics and creativity. Media formats covered include film, video, videodisc, multimedia, and CD-ROM productions. The database does not provide information about how to locate copies of the productions or where to view them.</p>
                  <p>The Art on Screen Database was hosted on Getty.edu from 2006 until the  retirement of the database software in 2018.  Since the database structure was extremely flat, it was decided to preserve the data as  .csv and .xls files.  Interested researchers may access the preserved data files through the link in the inventory below.</p>

                  <p>Records include surveys, press releases, clippings, correspondence, letters, reports, photographs, and printed materials, 1974, 1979-1997, regarding conferences, workshops, and educational outreach activities organized, hosted, or undertaken by the Program for Art on Film and the Production Laboratory. One of the earliest conferences, "Art on Film," was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the records document the planning activities for the conference. Education and outreach activities, such as participation in university courses, are documented in the records, as are symposia and screenings held at or with the Louvre and other museums, New York Women in Film, College Art Association and other professional organizations. Also included in the records are documents describing the planning of a seminar organized by the Production Laboratory in 1989 with filmmakers Adams and Goldbard.</p>

                  <p>Records consist of press materials, letters, worksheets, surveys, reports and brochures produced and collected by and for the Program for Art on Film, 1971-1979, 1984-1994. These records support the activities documented in the preceding series, such as the reports on film and video and the articles used for research and development; many are not original materials, i.e., records produced by the Program for Art on Film. Others are blank copies of surveys and forms that provide no contextual information, or correspondence that contains no contextual information. Included are miscellaneous materials not created by the Program for Art on Film but used for administrative purposes.</p>

               <p>Records consist of correspondence, memos, catalogs, brochures, inventories, press releases, clippings, photographs, articles, printed materials, resumes, programs, posters, books, films, magazines/journals, CD-ROMs, slides, and reports collected by the Program for Art on Film, 1951-1998. The bulk of these records were used to compile the Art on Screen ("Critical Inventory") database.</p>
               <p>The records describe American and international companies and organizations that produce and distribute films on art; individual films (both feature and documentary) that take as subject artists or art; conferences where films on art were screened; and miscellaneous informational materials. Much of this material is promotional in nature (catalogs, brochures, and press releases).</p>
               <p>The "Subject Files" (labeled as such by Program for Art on Film personnel) describe artists, films, organizations, projects, art historical time periods and movements, and such diverse topics as art education, attitudes towards films, international television markets, and management.</p>
               <p>The "People Files" (labeled as such by Program for Art on Film personnel) describe artists (both contemporary and deceased, working in a variety of media), filmmakers, art historians, and other individuals with interest in film and/or the arts. Some of the individuals represented in the records served as evaluators for the Program's publications (including its films).</p>
               <p>The records contain information in the form of catalogs, brochures, programs, and other printed matter documenting film festivals. These festivals, both national and international, were concerned specifically with films about art.</p>
               <p>The visual materials comprise posters, slides, and image-oriented interactive visual arts software. The posters included in the records are generally advertisements for films; also included are photographic images of two projects by the artist Christo.</p>

                  <p>Records consist of catalogs, brochures, inventories, press releases, clippings, photographs, printed materials, correspondence, and reports, collected by the Program for Art on Film, 1972-1997 and undated, that describe international companies and organizations that produce and distribute films on art. Much of the material is promotional in nature (catalogs, brochures, and press releases). The bulk of the records are printed materials; any correspondence found within the records contextualizes these records, and is often in response to a direct query by Program for Art on Film personnel. Some of the information was used to compile the Art on Screen ("Critical Inventory") database.</p>

                  <p>Records consist of catalogs, brochures, inventories, press releases, clippings, photographs, printed materials, and correspondence collected by the Program for Art on Film, 1974-1996 and undated, that describe individual films (both feature and documentary) that take as subject artists or art. Much of the material is promotional in nature (catalogs, brochures, and press releases). The bulk of the records are printed materials; any correspondence found within the records contextualizes these records, and is often in response to a direct query by Program for Art on Film personnel. Some of the information was used to compile the Art on Screen ("Critical Inventory") database.</p>
                  <p>For feature film reviews, see Series II.E. "Subject Files".</p>

                  <p>Records consist of catalogs, brochures, press releases, clippings, photographs, printed materials, and correspondence, collected by the Program for Art on Film, 1969-1997, that describe conferences where films on art were screened. Much of the material is promotional in nature (catalogs, brochures, and press releases). The bulk of the records are printed materials; any correspondence found within the records contextualizes these records, and is often in response to a direct query by Program for Art on Film personnel. Some of the information was used to compile the Art on Screen ("Critical Inventory") database.</p>

                  <p>Records consist of correspondence, resumes, clippings, and printed matter describing artists (both contemporary and deceased, working in a variety of media), filmmakers, art historians, and other individuals with interest in film and/or the arts, collected by the Program for Art on Film, 1960-1996. Some of the individuals represented in the records served as evaluators for the Program's publications (including its films). The bulk of the information was used to compile the Art on Screen ("Critical Inventory") database.</p>
