         <head>Administrative History and Project Background</head>
         <p>The Getty Research Institute (GRI) is an operating program of the J. Paul Getty Trust, a not-for-profit educational, cultural and philanthropic organization dedicated to the visual arts. Originally established in 1983 as the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities (GCHAH), the objective of the GCHAH was to foster advanced research in art, its history, diversity, and meaning in culture by engaging scholars from various disciplines in the humanities.  In 1996, in order to avoid confusion with the soon-to-open Getty Center, the GCHAH was renamed the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities and in 2000, the program's name was shortened to the Getty Research Institute (GRI). </p>
         <p>The GRI's mission is to further knowledge and advance understanding of the visual arts and their various histories through advanced research and scholarship, and through its activities and resources, provide a unique environment for research, critical inquiry, and scholarly exchange.  The GRI's Research Library, consisting of over one million books, periodicals, study photographs, auction catalogs and special collections of rare and unique materials, as well as its online resources and databases, serve an international community of scholars and the interested public. The GRI also provides intellectual leadership through its research projects, exhibitions, and publication programs and provides service to a wide range of scholars worldwide through residencies, fellowships, hosted lectures and symposia, and its innovative digital reference tools.  Through all of its programs and activities, the GRI endeavors to provide resources, expertise, and a collaborative environment for art-historical research and publication.</p>
         <p>Through multidisciplinary programming from the department of Contemporary Programs and Research (CPR) and its successor, the Department of Architecture and Contemporary Art (DACA), the GRI advanced art history scholarship of contemporary art. As part of this effort CPR, along with the GRI Office of the Associate Director of Programs, sponsored various poetry initiatives. One such initiative was Poetry in Motion ® L.A.  Originally founded in New York in 1992, it was brought to Los Angeles through a partnership founded in 1998 with the Poetry Society of America, the Getty Research Institute, the City of Santa Monica, and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Metro Art. Poets staged live readings of poetry in the Metro Rail system at rush hour in celebration of National Poetry Month. Additionally, the work of poets were inscribed on placards placed aboard nearly 2,400 Metro buses servicing over one million bus riders per day. </p>
         <p>In another partnership with outside institutions including Occidental College, Friends of the Los Angeles River, and Beyond Baroque, the GRI commissioned poems from seven poets about the Los Angeles River for Occidental College and Friends of the Los Angeles River 's "Re-Envisioning the Los Angeles River," a year-long series of events promoting community education and economic revitalization. </p>
         <p>Lastly, in conjunction with the GRI Scholar Program, the GRI commissioned poems from American poets from 1999 to 2002. The commissioned poems addressed the theme of each Scholar Program year and were presented in public and private readings at the Getty. </p>
