         <p>Phil Curtis created a box list in the summer of 2003, began a preliminary rehousing of the collection, and created and began encoding a preliminary finding aid in November 2004. Sue Luftschein completed the rehousing and restructured and completed this finding aid in August 2005. In 2009, Cyndi Shein processed material accessioned during the Legacy Records Appraisal Project and revised the finding aid accordingly. The acquisition of some of J. Paul Getty's personal papers and George F. and Sarah C. Getty's papers in 2010 introduced new content to the collection; Cyndi Shein processed and added the following accessions: 1997.IA.08; 1998.IA.07; 2006.IA.05; 2007.IA.32; and 2010.IA.17. She then restructured the intellectual arrangement of the materials and rewrote the finding aid to reflect the new nature of the collection. Cyndi Shein added accessions 2011.IA.44, 2012.IA.37, and 2014.IA.02. Sara Seltzer added accession 2018.IA.58. Nancy Enneking added accession 2019.IA.56</p>
         <p>Please note that accessions 1987.IA.11, 1992.IA.03, and 1998.IA.07 are housed in shared box 1986.IA.22-02. Accession 2002.IA.02 is housed with the other oversized photographs in box 1986.IA.48-12. Accessions 2004.IA.17, 2009.IA.36, and 2011.IA.44 are housed in shared box 1987.IA.16-01. Accessions 2014.IA.02 and 2018.IA.58 are housed in a shared box.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
         <p>The collection comprises materials gathered from a variety of sources that relate to art collector and oil tycoon J. Paul Getty and his parents, George F. Getty I and Sarah C. Getty.  The collection includes correspondence, art and furniture inventories, financial records, legal documents, publications, ephemera, and photographs, dating from approximately 1880 to 1989 and undated.</p>
         <p>The collected papers on J. Paul Getty include some of his personal and business correspondence and other documents, providing insight into his art collecting activities, his business ventures, and his personal and family relationships.  The financial records primarily describe the affairs of Getty family businesses as well as Getty's estate at the time of his death.  The legal documents describe legal and financial relationships within the Getty family through correspondence, wills, prenuptial agreements, divorce decrees, financial settlements, child and spousal support agreements, and other supporting documents.  The little material relating to his marriages is mostly represented among his legal files. Materials related to Mr. Getty's publications contain correspondence with co-authors and publishers, typescripts and drafts of his books, and copies of his published books and articles.  The collected papers also contain documents postdating Mr. Getty's death (1977, 1980-1989) that concern the management of his estate and eulogize his life and accomplishments. </p>
         <p>The collected George F. Getty I and Sarah C. Getty papers include letters, telegrams, hand-drawn maps, cancelled stock certificates, contracts, promissory notes, travel documents, receipts, and various forms of ephemera.  The family correspondence includes letters written by J. Paul Getty to his parents that provide insight into the personal and early business relationships between George, Sarah, and Paul.  While the family correspondence hints at the atmosphere of the Getty household, George's papers shed light on his early oil operations, including scouting potential drilling sites, day-to-day management of drilling activities, and his political efforts to protect his interests/land in the Osage Nation (part of the Indian Territory that was annexed by the United States government that later became the state of Oklahoma).  Sarah's mostly peripheral involvement in the family business is evidenced by her correspondence with George and several notarized documents.  </p>
         <p>The photographs consist primarily of black-and-white photographs and negatives, dating from approximately the 1880s to the 1970s, of J. Paul Getty, family, friends, properties, and city and landscape views. The photographs also include several images of the J. Paul Getty Museum and galleries during its early years. The images are of various sizes, and are largely undated and unidentified.  The majority of these photographs once belonged to J. Paul Getty, while a smaller number of them seem to have belonged to his father, George F. Getty I.  The photographs come from several different sources, including Ralph Hewins, Getty's biographer.  </p>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>American oil tycoon and art collector Jean Paul Getty was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on December 15, 1892 to George Franklin Getty (1855-1930) and Sarah Catherine McPherson Risher Getty (1852-1941). George was an attorney and insurance executive whose 1903 visit to oil-rich Osage land in Indian Territory (a region that was annexed by the United States government that later became the State of Oklahoma in 1907) inspired him to lease land and begin drilling, launching his career in the petroleum industry. In 1905 the Getty family moved to Los Angeles, but George maintained his oil business in Oklahoma, traveling to the oil fields periodically. Jean Paul, called "Paul," attended a private military school before going on to college. He first attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and later transferred to the University of California, Berkeley (1909 to 1911). In November of 1912 he began his studies at Magdalen College at Oxford University in England and received a diploma in Politics and Economics in June 1913. He then enhanced his education by means of a Grand Tour of Europe, viewing art collections and ancient ruins that sparked his interest in art and antiquities. He also toured parts of the Middle East and North Africa before returning to the United States in September of 1914.</p>
         <p>In 1914, Paul joined the family petroleum business and spent a year in the oil fields of Oklahoma. An investment in 160 acres near Stone Bluff, Oklahoma led to Paul's announcement two years later that he had earned his first million dollars. He then lived the carefree life of a rich young bachelor in Los Angeles for more than a year before his father convinced him to return to the oil business in Oklahoma. Soon thereafter Paul persuaded his father to shift the focus of the family business operations to the Los Angeles basin. Paul continued to work for the family company in addition to conducting oil drilling of his own, securing the family fortune by the time the stock market crashed in 1929. Upon his death in 1930, George left controlling interest in the company to Sarah. In 1934 Paul forced Sarah out of control of the company and gave her an annuity. His fortune grew as he acquired the controlling interest in several companies and became the head of a vast organization with activities in oil exploration, transportation, production and marketing, as well as minerals, manufacturing, real estate and agriculture. In the mid-1940s Paul bought the Saudi Arabian portion of the lease on the mineral rights in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait; his wealth dramatically increased when this site produced oil in 1953.</p>
         <p>Beginning in the early 1930s, J. Paul Getty lived in a house he built next to William Randolph Hearst's on the beach in Santa Monica. During World War II he moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma for four years to supervise wartime production of parts for Allied aircraft at his Spartan Aircraft plant. In 1945 he purchased 64 acres in Malibu, California and renovated the existing hacienda, known as the Ranch House, where he lived until 1951. (See finding aid IA20021 for records regarding the Ranch House.) When Getty departed the United States for Europe in 1951, he kept his Malibu estate for the display of his art collection and for his eventual return to California. The J. Paul Getty Museum Trust was incorporated in December 1953; The J. Paul Getty Museum at the Ranch House opened to the public in April 1954.</p>
         <p>Getty had been collecting art since the 1930s. In 1938 he made his first major purchases: a group of furniture; a carpet that had belonged to Louis XIV, often called the "Ardabil Carpet"; and Rembrandt's <emph render="italic">Marten Looten</emph> (he donated the Ardabil Carpet and the Rembrandt to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1954). Another of his strong interests was antiquities, inspired by his travels throughout Europe and by visits to the Vatican Museums. He took pride in being knowledgeable in the areas in which he was collecting and in finding bargains. Getty continued to collect art throughout his lifetime, despite occasional assertions that he was no longer in the market. While some objects were expressly purchased for the Getty Museum, Mr. Getty also maintained a personal art collection, some of which was on long-term loan to the museum. By 1968 his art collection had begun to outgrow the Ranch House and he began planning a new building on the property to properly house these works. He chose to pattern this new museum building after a first-century Roman country house, based primarily on the plans of the ancient Villa dei Papiri near Herculaneum. This museum, often called the Getty Villa, opened to the public on January 16, 1974.</p>
         <p>After leaving the United States in 1951, Getty lived in hotel suites in Europe until 1960 when he moved to Sutton Place, a historic 72-room Tudor manor located 25 miles southwest of London. In 1957 <emph render="italic">Fortune</emph> magazine designated Getty as the world's wealthiest man, and he became the object of considerable public interest. For the rest of his life, both the respectable press and the tabloids reported on his perceived eccentricities and his private life.</p>
         <p>Getty married and divorced five times and had five children with four of his wives.</p>

         <p>J. Paul Getty died in England on June 6, 1976 without ever returning to California. Although he never saw the museum, he is buried at the Getty Villa property on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Much to everyone's surprise, Getty left the bulk of his fortune to the museum, requesting that the funds be employed to promote "the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge." </p>

The curators' notes are diary excerpts and notes taken by Getty Museum curators who were given a brief opportunity to examine Mr. Getty's diaries after his death.  The notes relate to the curators' areas of interest, such as the provenance and acquisition of art objects and the collecting habits of Mr. Getty; the notes do not reflect the contents of the diaries as a whole.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>Material comprises some of the personal papers and business records maintained by art collector and oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, gathered from a variety of sources.  Material dates from 1909 to 1977 and includes personal correspondence, financial records, and legal documents.</p>
                  <p>The correspondence primarily consists of letters received by J. Paul Getty ("Paul") dating from 1912-1914 and 1926-1977.  The early correspondence is the most personal; it reflects the relationship between Paul and his parents and hints at the relationships between Paul and two of his wives, Helen "Ann" Rork and Louise Dudley "Teddy" Lynch. A small selection of letters were sent from Getty to an acquaintance, Ann Mitchell. The correspondence from "friends and acquaintances" varies in content and degree of intimacy.  Correspondence from "others" primarily contains letters from persons not acquainted with Mr. Getty and contains letters about various business ventures and interests, requests for information, fan mail, and letters of acknowledgment from Getty's staff in response to the incoming mail.  Some of the correspondence to Mr. Getty from others post-dates his death.</p>
                  <p>The financial records consist of a promissory note, correspondence, financial statements, annual reports, a will, and tax statements relating to J. Paul Getty and the J. Paul Getty estate, dating 1909, 1926, 1928, 1932 to 1942, 1950 to 1957, 1976 to 1977, and undated. The records primarily describe the financial well-being of Getty family businesses as well as Getty's estate at the time of his death.  The earliest document (1909) is a hand-written note signed by seventeen-year-old Paul to his father, George F. Getty I, acknowledging the partial receipt of his allowance ($2.60). Some of the early tax and financial documents postdate George F. Getty's death, but concern his various companies.  Other records detail the status of J. Paul Getty's estate and his personal financial status through tax returns and financial statements.</p>
                  <p>The legal documents describe legal and financial relationships within the Getty family through correspondence, wills, and other legal documents, dating from 1926 to 1976.  The materials include an unsigned carbon copy of an early J. Paul Getty will (dated May 1, 1950) and  a copy of Sarah C. Getty's will.  Some of the records concern Getty's wives and children, including prenuptial agreements, divorce decrees, financial settlements, alimony discussions, child support negotiations, and an inventory of possessions. These records concern Getty's second wife, Allene Ashby; his third wife, Adolphine "Fini" Helmle; his fourth wife, Helen "Ann" Rork; and his fifth wife, Louise Dudley "Teddy" Lynch. </p>
                  <p>The other papers comprise various dissociated papers of J. Paul Getty, dating from 1920 to 1952 and undated.  The papers include samples of his early schoolwork; receipts for auto purchases; vital records and meeting minutes from some of his oil companies; notes regarding diet and health; and scattered diary entries.  Please note that the Institutional Archives, Getty Research Institute holds Mr. Getty's more complete diaries: J. Paul Getty Diaries (1938-1946, 1948-1976), Finding aid no. IA40009. </p>

               <head>Biographical Note</head>
               <p>George Franklin Getty I (1855-1930) and Sarah Catherine McPherson Risher Getty (1852-1941) were the parents of billionaire Jean Paul Getty, whom they called "Paul."  Sarah and George met at Michigan University and were married in 1879.  They used Sarah's dowry of one hundred dollars to pay off George's college debt, enabling him to leave his teaching job at a grammar school to study law.  </p>
               <p>George graduated from Michigan University's Law Department in 1882 and passed the bar exam shortly thereafter.  He became a successful attorney and insurance executive in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  In 1890 a typhoid epidemic struck the Getty family, severely weakening Sarah and claiming their daughter, Gertrude Lois Getty (age ten).  Although George and Sarah felt the loss of Gertrude for the rest of their lives, they were overjoyed with the birth of their son, Paul, in 1892.</p>
               <p>In 1903 George traveled from Minneapolis on legal business to Bartlesville in the Indian Territory (a region annexed in 1907 by the United State government to create the state of Oklahoma).  There he began his career in the petroleum industry by leasing "Lot 50" in the Osage Nation and incorporating the Minnehoma Oil Company.  In 1905 the Getty family moved to Los Angeles, in the hope that the warm, dry climate of California would improve Sarah's health.  George and Sarah soon built a Tudor-style home at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and South Kingsley Drive in Los Angeles, which was maintained as a primary residence until Sarah's death in 1941.  </p>
               <p>George tended his growing oil business in Oklahoma and elsewhere, traveling periodically from the family home in Los Angeles to the oil fields, sometimes accompanied by Paul and Sarah.  By 1907 George had ceased to practice law and was focused on his oil business.  He established an office at the Union Oil Building (at 7th and Spring streets) in Los Angeles in 1913.  George employed family members in his oil business, including his brother, "D. L." Getty; his sister Belle's husband, J. Carl Smith; and his sister Laura's husband, H. L. Allen. </p>
               <p>George died in 1930, leaving controlling interest of the family oil business to Sarah.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Material comprises personal and professional papers of George Franklin Getty I and Sarah C. Getty, parents of Jean Paul Getty ("Paul").  Material dates from 1890 to 1939 and includes letters, telegrams, hand-drawn maps, cancelled stock certificates, contracts, promissory notes, travel documents, receipts, and various forms of ephemera. The family correspondence includes letters written by J. Paul Getty to his parents that provide insight into the personal and early business relationships between George, Paul, and Sarah.  While the family correspondence hints at the atmosphere of the Getty household, George's papers shed light on his early oil operations, including scouting potential drilling sites, day-to-day management of drilling activities, and his political efforts to protect his interests/land in the Osage Nation (part of the territory that the United States government annexed in 1907 to form the state of Oklahoma).  Sarah's mostly peripheral involvement in the family business is evinced by her correspondence with George and several notarized documents.  Please note that although Sarah signed personal correspondence "Sara," most of the notarized documents and J. Paul Getty's autobiography spell her first name "Sarah," by which she is more commonly known.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>Material comprises some personal and professional papers of George Franklin Getty I, father of Jean Paul Getty ("Paul"), dating 1890-1928 and undated.  The family correspondence comprises letters received by George F. Getty I from various family members.  The letters from his son, J. Paul Getty ("Paul"), primarily concern Paul's residence and travel abroad and usually include Paul's requests for funds.  Letters from his wife, Sarah, address a blend of parenting, domestic, and business concerns.  Because George employed his family in his business, letters from his siblings and other relatives contain news regarding family, real estate transactions, property management, and oil operations.  The family history is an account of George Getty's ancestry as told by George's uncle, Joseph Getty.</p>
                  <p>The business and personal papers provide a glimpse of George's early oil operations, including scouting potential drilling sites, day-to-day management of drilling activities, and political efforts to protect his interests/land in the Osage Nation, part of Indian Territory that the United States government annexed that later became the state of Oklahoma in 1907.  Material includes letters, telegrams, hand-drawn maps, cancelled stock certificates, contracts, promissory notes, and other documents.  Most of the letters are outgoing correspondence written by George F. Getty I.  As was customary at the time, a reply to a letter is sometimes written directly on top of the original letter, thus a single sheet may contain an outgoing letter and its incoming response.  The general incoming and outgoing correspondence are primarily related to property management, banking, and general business activities. Material also includes some papers that belonged to George's secretary, Mable McCreery.</p>
                  <p>Material also includes dissociated ephemera collected by or related to George F. Getty I, including a paper-cut portrait of Mr. Getty and one loose-leaf, handmade scrapbook containing pressed fauna and flora, accompanied by short hand-written descriptions, which was likely sent to him by one of his relatives in Washington state.</p>

                  <p>Material comprises papers, with dates scattered between 1908 and 1939, once belonging to Sarah Catherine McPherson Risher Getty (1852-1941), including four letters, one postcard, and a souvenir booklet from her son, J. Paul Getty.  Also included are two postcards from other relatives, a promissory note, and a few documents related to real estate development and water association stocks.  Some documents are signed by both Sarah and her husband, George.  Please note that although Sarah signed personal correspondence "Sara," most of the notarized documents and J. Paul Getty's autobiography spell her first name "Sarah," by which she is more commonly known.</p>

               <p>The provenance of the photographs has been obscured by time.  In an effort to improve access, the photographic prints and negatives in each accession are arranged in binders and roughly grouped by subject. </p>
               <p>Sets of photographic negatives, when present, have been placed at the back of the last binder of each accession. Sets have been assigned alphabetical identities by the Archives to facilitate retrieval.  Rather than attempting to match the negatives with corresponding prints, these sets of negatives have been left in the order in which they were received.</p>
               <p>Individual negatives created by the Archives have been housed with their associated prints when possible.</p>

               <p>Materials consist primarily of black-and-white photographs and negatives, dating from approximately the 1880s to the 1970s, of J. Paul Getty, family, friends, properties, and city and landscape views. The materials also include several images of the J. Paul Getty Museum and galleries during its early years. The images are black-and-white unless otherwise specified.</p>
               <p>The images are of various sizes, and are largely undated and unidentified.  The majority of these photographs once belonged to J. Paul Getty, while a smaller number of them seem to have belonged to his father, George F. Getty I.  The photographs come from several different sources, including Ralph Hewins, Getty's biographer.   </p>
               <p>When negatives were found together in an envelope they have been kept together in a set.  The photographic prints, having arrived in the archives in a state of complete disarray, have been roughly organized by subject.  Negatives can be found for some of the prints in this group of photographs and vice versa, but such relationships are uncommon.</p>
               <p>Please note that image counts are approximate and represent the number of unique images (not counting duplicates).</p>
