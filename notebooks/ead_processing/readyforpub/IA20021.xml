         <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
         <p>Records consist of correspondence, memoranda, reports, contracts, permits, invoices, brochures, clippings, blueline prints, blueprints, architectural drawings, and photographs, 1921, 1945-1960s, 1975-1976, 1980s, 1999-2007 and undated, that describe J. Paul Getty's Ranch House in Malibu, California and the alterations made to it over time.</p>
         <p>The history of the building is summarized in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) documentation, which provides background information on the Ranch House, including its significance, history, architecture, a site description, maps, plans, and photographs. The renovation and administration records contain information about work undertaken in the 1950s to expand gallery space by the Los Angeles architectural firm of Claud Beelman &amp; Associates; the financial administration of the project was handled by Norris Bramlett. The records describe preparations for a proposed visit by Getty to the Ranch in the 1960s through copies of correspondence between Getty, Norris Bramlett, and Eileen Vogler, a long-time Getty employee. In March 1973, the Trustees passed a resolution requesting that Getty authorize construction of an access road to the Museum, and the records contain information about the costs and planning of this project. In the late 1970s the Trustees explored the possibility of expanding the Ranch House for more gallery space. Gruen Associates was retained to advise the Trustees, and their report, related correspondence, and a geological investigation is included in the records. Also included in the records are two inventories of the collections conducted in the late 1970s (the purpose of these inventories is unknown); and letters from Stephen Garrett, Museum Director, to the Ranch House staff discussing their transfer to museum staff. The records also include architectural drawings, a large portion of which relate to the renovation of the property by the architect John Byers, begun in 1946, for both residential and art gallery spaces in the house. The photographs included in the records depict the Ranch House before, during, and after renovation.</p>

         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>Located just off the Pacific Coast Highway about a mile north of Sunset Boulevard on 64-acres near Malibu, California, the Ranch House became the site for the original J. Paul Getty Museum. Purchased by J. Paul Getty in 1945 from Claude I. Parker for the sum of $250,000, the property was originally part of an early nineteenth century Spanish land grant. In the 1920s Parker, a Los Angeles attorney, purchased a portion of the property from Perfecto Marquez, a descendent of one of the area's original settlers. Parker constructed a house, the core of the extant Ranch House, and several outbuildings. Getty made additions and major alterations to the Ranch House, including the addition of a second floor to the eastern portion, creating the house that stands on the property today.</p>
         <p>At the time Getty purchased the Malibu property, he already owned a house in Santa Monica, at 270 Ocean Front, and therefore only occupied the Ranch House on weekends. In 1946, Getty commissioned the Los Angeles architect John Byers to design additions to the Ranch House, primarily to house Getty's art collections, including a second floor at the eastern end, the Louis XV Room, the Hallway Gallery, the Louis XVI Room, the Small Antiquities Room, and the Courtyard. In 1953 Mr. Getty established the J. Paul Getty Museum Trust and in 1954 opened the gallery spaces at the eastern end of the house to the public. In 1957, a new gallery wing along the west edge of the courtyard was added by the Los Angeles-based architectural firm Claud Beelman and Associates to house Getty's expanding collection of antiquities. The eastern end of the house continued to function as the museum until 1974 (with about 6,000 square feet of exhibition space), when the Getty Villa was completed and opened as the primary repository for Mr. Getty's art collection.</p>
         <p>With the Getty Villa acting as the new museum quarters, portions of the Ranch House were altered to accommodate museum administration and conservation laboratories. Major modifications to the interior of the Ranch House, including the conversion of gallery spaces to conservation, laboratory and office spaces. The construction of new buildings in the courtyard area were carried out during the mid-1980s.</p>
         <p>The Ranch House was the subject of a 2001 Historic American Buildings Survey report.</p>

               <p>Records consist of correspondence, memoranda, reports, contracts, permits, invoices, brochures, and clippings, 1954-1982, pertaining to J. Paul Getty's Ranch House in Malibu, California. The records describe additions and alterations to the Ranch House, and administrative matters pertaining to its maintenance and upkeep. </p>
               <p>The records contain information about work undertaken to expand gallery space by the Los Angeles architectural firm of Claud Beelman &amp; Associates, and P.J. Walker Company Builders, in the 1950s; the financial administration of the project was handled by Norris Bramlett. The records describe preparations for a proposed visit by Getty to the Ranch in the 1960s through copies of correspondence between Getty, Norris Bramlett, and Eileen Vogler, interior designer. In March 1973, the Trustees passed a resolution requesting that Getty authorize construction of an access road to the Museum, along Los Liones Road. The records contain detailed information about the costs and planning of this project. In the late 1970s the Trustees explored the possibility of expanding the Ranch House for more gallery space. Gruen Associates was retained to advise the Trustees; their report, related correspondence, and a geological investigation conducted by LeRoy Crandall &amp; Associates is included in the records. The records also contain two inventories of the collections conducted in the late 1970s (the purpose of these inventories is unknown); and letters from Stephen Garrett, Museum Director, to the Ranch House staff discussing their transfer to museum staff.</p>

               <p>Records consist of blueprints, blueline prints, and architectural drawings, 1921, 1945-1951, 1975-1976 and undated, from various J. Paul Getty Ranch House renovation and alteration projects. A large portion of this material relates to the renovation of the property by the architect John Byers of Santa Monica, begun in 1946, for both residential and art gallery spaces in the house, and a 1950 art gallery renovation. In some cases the purpose, or jobs, for which drawings were created is unknown.</p>
