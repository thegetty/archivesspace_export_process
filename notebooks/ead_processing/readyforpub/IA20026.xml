         <p>The collection comprises audio recordings, video recordings, and photographs of the people and events related to the Getty Research Institute Scholars Program and its predecessors, dating from 1985 to 2013. </p>
         <p>The audiovisual recordings primarily comprise audiocassette and compact disc recordings of lectures, panel discussions, conferences, and other events hosted by the Getty Research Institute and given by Getty Scholars, staff, and invited speakers, dating from 1987 to 2001. Many of the recordings have been digitized. The lectures and events hosted by the Scholars Program tend to focus on the given theme for that particular scholar year. Other symposia and conferences represented in this collection cover various topics, and, although held at a Getty facility and attended by Getty Scholars, may not have been hosted by the Scholars Program. Also included are video tapes of a symposium on Florentine patronage (1986-1987) and a viewing schedule covering the research theme of the Getty Scholars Program for the 1986/1987 year: "Seventeenth Century Dutch Art and Society/Patronage." </p>
         <p>The images principally comprise portraits of scholars from 1985 to 2007, contact sheets, negatives, and oversize photograph prints (8"x10" and 11"x14"). The photographs were primarily used to select official scholar portraits, but they also document to a lesser extent the outings, events, and lectures that Getty Scholars attended. </p>
         <p>The collection also includes restricted photo releases signed by scholars from 1997 to 2013.</p>

         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>The Getty Research Institute (GRI) is a program developed and overseen by the J. Paul Getty Trust, an international cultural and philanthropic organization serving both general audiences and specialized professionals. The Trust is a not-for-profit institution, educational in purpose and character that focuses on the visual arts in all of their dimensions. The Trust currently supports and oversees four programs: the J. Paul Getty Museum; the Getty Foundation; the Getty Conservation Institute; and the Getty Research Institute (GRI).</p>
         <p>Located at the Getty Center in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, the GRI creates and disseminates new knowledge through its expertise, its active collecting program, public programs, institutional collaborations, exhibitions, publications, digital services, and residential scholars program. The GRI also provides intellectual leadership through its research projects and its innovative digital reference tools. The GRI's Research Library, consisting of over one million books, periodicals, study photographs, auction catalogs and special collections of rare and unique materials, serve an international community of scholars and the interested public. The activities and scholarly resources of the GRI guide and sustain each other and, together, provide a unique environment for research, critical inquiry, and debate.
 
The origins of the J. Paul Getty Trust date to 1953, when J. Paul Getty established the J. Paul Getty Museum as a California charitable trust to house his growing art collections. Originally a small, private institution located in Mr. Getty's Ranch House near Malibu, California, the museum moved to the newly constructed Getty Villa on grounds adjacent to the Ranch House in 1974. When most of Mr. Getty's personal estate passed to the Trust in 1982, the Trustees decided that, given the size of the endowment, it should make a greater contribution to the visual arts and humanities than the museum could alone. </p>
         <p>The establishment of an arts library had already been proposed as early as 1977 by then Museum Director Stephen Garrett, when in February 1982, Trust President Harold Williams' chief deputy Nancy Englander outlined a proposed "Center for Advanced Study." This proposed center would include a residence program for scholars, a major expansion of the library, a limited publications program, and an art photo archive. The center would focus on the preservation of historic art history materials and the development of new art history reference tools using state-of-the-art information technology. The plan was approved and the Getty Center for the History of the Arts and the Humanities (GCHAH) opened in temporary quarters in the First Federal Building at 401 Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica, in July 1983. In 1996, in order to avoid confusion with the soon-to-open Getty Center in Brentwood, the GCHAH was renamed the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities. In 2000, the program's name was shortened to the GRI.</p>
         <p>Noted architectural historian Kurt Forster began work as the first director of the GCHAH in the fall of 1984. One of the original departments in the GCHAH was the Visiting Scholars and Conferences department, headed by Herb Hymans, and it was this department that inaugurated the Scholars Program in the fall of 1985, inviting 17 scholars and fellows to explore the theme "Aesthetic Experience and Affinities Among the Arts." Since that first year, the number of scholars has fluctuated between 20 and 30, but the treatment and consideration of a specific theme has remained a constant. </p>
         <p>In addition to hosting the Scholars Program, the Visiting Scholars and Conferences department was also responsible for organizing scholarly activities, events, and conferences. The department went through several name changes and restructuring in the years that followed. In the mid-1990s, it was renamed the Scholars and Seminars Program and later renamed the Scholars and Conferences Department. In 1998, its activities were encompassed in the new Department of Research and Education, which included the development of new art historical scholarship and to consolidate programming activities. As a result of the GRI reorganization in 2009, the department was split into two: a new department, Research Projects and Programs, and the Scholars Program dedicated to scholar activities. As of 2009, the Scholars Program reports directly to the Director of the GRI.  </p>

               <p>The material consists of audiocassette and compact disc recordings of lectures, panel discussions, conferences, and other events hosted by the Getty Research Institute (and its predecessors) and given by Getty Scholars, staff, and invited speakers, 1987-2001. Every year since 1985 the Research Institute has invited scholars, artists, and other cultural figures from around the world to work in residence at the Institute on projects that bear upon its annual research theme. While in residence, they pursue their own research projects, make use of Getty collections, and participate in the intellectual life of the Getty Center and the Getty Villa.The lectures and events hosted by the Scholars Program tend to focus on the given theme for that particular scholar year (see <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest"
                          xlink:href="http://www.getty.edu/research/scholarly_activities/annual_themes/past.html"
                          xlink:show="new">Past Themes and Scholars in Residence</extref> for a list of past scholars and scholar year themes). Other lectures and events represented in this collection, although held at the Getty Center and attended by Getty Scholars, were not specifically hosted by the Scholars Program and cover varied topics. These include ongoing series such as Works-in-Progress as well as special symposia and conferences held at the Getty Center.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1986/1987. During this time Getty Scholars explored two research themes: Seventeenth Century Dutch painting and the broader issues of art patronage. The scholars were drawn from disciplines ranging from art history to economic history. While most of the lectures given during this academic year were inspired by the scholar theme "Seventeenth Century Dutch Art and Society/Patronage," some of the lectures are not thematically related.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1987/1988. During this time Getty Scholars pursued individual areas of research while also exploring the theme of reception and interpretation of works of art and cultural products. Scholars approached this theme from their personal areas of expertise, which ranged from photography through ethnomathematics. While many of the lectures given during this academic year were inspired by the scholar theme: "Reception and Interpretation of the Arts," some of the recordings are not thematically related.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1988/1989.  During this time Getty Scholars focused on the distinctive qualities of cultural products selected for historical analysis or the ways in which scholarly interpretations are linked to particular methodological and theoretical assumptions. Many stressed close observation of cultural customs, traditions, and patterns of production. Others examined disciplinary practices and their interpretive strategies. Vital contributions were made toward fashioning interdisciplinary approaches for analyzing cultural continuities and changes. This group of scholars was drawn from the fields of anthropology, ethnography, the history of art, social history, and sociology. While many of the lectures given during this academic year were inspired by the scholar theme "The Production of Artifacts and the Formation of Disciplines," some of the lectures are not thematically related.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1989/1990. During this year the Getty Scholars played an important role in the development of a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to the arts of the early twentieth century, especially those called avant-garde, by increasing our understanding of the cultures in which they flourished. The fields of interest represented included comparative literature, the history of art and architecture, musicology, psychology, and film history. While most of the lectures given during this academic year were inspired by the scholar theme "The Avant-Garde," some of the lectures are not thematically related.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1990/1991. This scholar year was originally centered around classical antiquity. A broad spectrum of scholars working in that field were invited, together with a smaller satellite group working on the Ancient Near East, Africa, Pre-Columbian America, and Asia. The group of scholars who accepted the invitation engaged in a rich comparativist interplay related to their studies in Pre-Columbian and colonial Peru, Africa, the Ancient Near East, Etruscan Italy, and the Hellenistic world. In the end, only Asia was unrepresented. While most of the lectures given during this academic year were inspired by the scholar theme "Time and Ritual in Antiquity," some of the lectures are not thematically related.</p>

                     <p>The Anyone Conference was held at the University of California, Los Angeles. This conference was the first in a series of Any conferences, which took place in the decade leading up to the year 2000.  Multidisciplinary and cross-cultural in nature, the "Any" conferences focused on the condition of architecture at the end of the millennium.  Participants in the 1991 conference included Akira Asada, Francesco Dal Co, Jacques Derrida, Peter Eisenman, William Gibson, Arata Isozaki, Fredric Jameson, Kojin Karatani, Jeffrey Kipnis, Rem Koolhaas, Rosalind Krauss, Rafael Moneo, John Rajchman, Ignasi de Solà-Morales Rubió, David Salle, R.E. Somol, Mark C. Taylor, Roberto Mangabeira Unger, and Anthony Vidler. Materials comprise master audiocassettes, as well as copies.</p>
                     <p>Lectures that were conducted at the conference, but of which audio files were not found, include: Ignasi de Solà-Morales Rubió: "From Autonomy to Untimeliness"; Frank Gehry: "Hook, Line, and Signature"; Maria Nordman: "Infinite Openness"; and Daniel Libeskind: "ANYONE? A Text for a Ventriloquist."</p>
                     <p>Additional information can be found at http://www.anycorp.com/any_conferences.php</p>
                     <p>Several lectures are incomplete due to missing cassette recordings or inadvertent loss during the transfer process from cassette tapes to computer audio files. </p>

                     <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1990/1991. This scholar year was originally centered around classical antiquity. A broad spectrum of scholars working in that field were invited, together with a smaller satellite group working on the Ancient Near East, Africa, Pre-Columbian America, and Asia. The group of scholars who accepted the invitation engaged in a rich comparativist interplay related to their studies in Pre-Columbian and colonial Peru, Africa, the Ancient Near East, Etruscan Italy, and the Hellenistic world. In the end, only Asia was unrepresented. While most of the lectures given during this academic year were inspired by the scholar theme "Time and Ritual in Antiquity," some of the lectures are not thematically related.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1991/1992.  The theme for the year was "Popular and Mass Culture." During this time scholars engaged in research of the realms of expression variously labeled traditional, popular, folk, ethnic, and commercial. Research focused on the nature and impact of popular and traditional beliefs on religion, education, imagery, and culture from the Middle Ages to the present. The fields of study represented included art, architecture, dance, literature, philosophy, and film.</p>
                  <p>From March to June of 1992, selected events were conducted under Thomas Reese's project, <emph render="italic">Shifting Boundaries/Contested Space</emph>, a collection of presentations based on popular culture, the overall theme for that year. Several panels, series, and conferences are included for the 1991-1992 scholar year, and of those that were explicitly stated in the recordings to be part of the project, their inclusion is stated in a note.    </p>

                     <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1991/1992 that were not part of specific symposia or conferences.  The theme for the year was "Popular and Mass Culture." During this time scholars engaged in research of expression variously labeled traditional, popular, folk, ethnic, and commercial. They explored the thresholds between these categories. Research focused on the nature and impact of popular and traditional beliefs on religion, education, imagery, and culture from the Middle Ages to the present. The fields of study represented included art, architecture, dance, literature, philosophy, and film.</p>
                     <p>Some of the recordings in this section were part of larger group of lectures under a project headed by Thomas Reese and David Jensen, the Shifting Boundaries/Contested Space series (a group of presentations based on popular culture).  The relationship between the recording and the series has been noted where known, but it is possible that not all of the recordings in the series have been identified.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of discussions and lectures related to the performance, "Perspectives on LA at the Jodo Shu Betsuin Buddhist Temple," which was part of a series of public programs in downtown Los Angeles that coincided with the Getty/ CalArts joint conference on "The Aesthetics of Community-Based Art Making."  The intent of the event was to discuss issues raised by the arts with respect to culture, identity, democracy, and education, while considering the arts as an agent of cultural change.  This event was part of the Getty Scholar Year 1992/1993, which was themed "The Metropolis as Crucible."</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of an event held at the Getty during the scholar year 1993/1994 under the theme "The Americas."  The recordings capture African American male poets/writers each telling a "story" or reciting a poem about  an experience from their own lives and discussing why that memory is meaningful to them. Following individual readings is a discussion between writer-director Keith Antar Mason, professional barbers, and participating poets revealing the barbershop as central to African American culture--a place where men experience symbolic rites of passage and bond as they share experiences, folklore, and milestones in their lives.</p>
                     <p>The Getty documented the Hittite Empire theater troupe's process of connecting the oral history tradition transposed from Africa to L.A.'s urban barbershops.  Keith Antar Mason's research on barbershops was the basis for a theater piece, "Sexual Illegals," performed by the Hittite Empire, which was one of five Memory Projects commissioned as part of the 1993 L.A. Festival.  The recordings herein are related to this performance, but do not document it.</p>

                     <p>Participants included an international group of arts administrators, artists, curators, and critics who discuss issues of access to cultural decision-making, relationships between public and private spheres, questions of audience and community, and ethical concerns about the control of distribution of works of art, images, and ideas.  </p>
                     <p>Panelists included David Avalos, visual artist, Los Angeles; Marie Claude-Beaud, Cartier Foundation, France; Olivier Debroise, novelist and culture critic, Mexico; Tom Finkelpearl, Public Arts Program, New York; Felix Gonzalez-Torres, artist, Group Material USA, New York;  Vasif Kortun, curator, Istanbul; James Luna, artist, La Jolla Reservation, California; Declan McGonagle, Museum Director, Dublin, and others.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of lectures from "Cine City: Film and Perceptions of Urban Space, 1895-1995," a symposium that explored film's role in visualizing the future and how architecture has affected the evolution of film. The five-day international symposium brought together architects, filmmakers, production designers, and architecture and film historians to examine the city as represented in film and its relationship to built form. The symposium was held in 1994 in conjunction with a two-week series of film screenings organized by the Getty that included documentaries, feature films, and experimental films.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise 1994 audio recordings of seminars that launched a continued lecture series, "Imaging the City in the Americas. . ."  The prototypical seminar was developed by GRI Deputy Director Thomas Reese and a Getty research group that included Claudia Bohn-Spector, Research Project Analyst; Wim De Wit, Head of Special Collections; Margarita Gutman, Getty Scholar, 1993-1994; and Carol McMichael Reese, Scholar Associate. According to Reese, "the research focus of the seminar [was] to consider how the image of the American city came into being and how it functioned in the construction of civic identities.  In a multidisciplinary and comparative approach to the subject, and within the context of social, political, and economic conditions of urbanization, the seminar [focused] on selected cities that experienced rapid demographic change and economic expansion in the early 20th century, in order to examine the relationship between the politics of their development and their visual representation in popular culture, art, and literature.  The objective [was] to illuminate not only the means by which ideas and images of urban form were constructed for, as well as by, various urban constituencies, but also the full range of modernist technologies that were harnessed for these purposes.  Initial seminar sessions focused on Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and Los Angeles."</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of a series of instructional lectures presented by art historian Linda Seidel during the scholar year 1993/1994. These five lectures, although hosted by the Getty, were thematically unrelated to other events that year; they were part of a graduate seminar taught by Professor Seidel at UCLA.  The lectures focus on Flemish portraiture in the 15th century with significant attention paid to the <emph render="italic">Arnolfini Wedding Portrait</emph>, <emph render="italic">Ghent Altarpiece</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Freidsam Annunciation</emph> by Jan Van Eyck.  Lectures touch on work by Robert Campin, Willem van Haecht, and many others.  Seidel also discusses Erwin Panofsky's book <emph render="italic">Early Netherlandish Painting</emph>, explores relationships between the writings of Pliny and Flemish painting, and talks about the influences of the culture and religion of the 15th century upon the paintings of the time.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1993/1994 that were not part of larger symposia or series within that year.  The theme for the year was "The Americas." Scholars researched a very wide variety of topics related to the cultures of the Americas, from Pre-Columbian times to the present and their contributions addressed issues related to empire, colonialism, diasporas, and cultural contact, as well as the impact of these events on artistic and cultural production.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1994/1995, which was themed "Memory."  The GRI extended invitations to a broad range of scholars whose work explored the subject of memory as a psychological, cultural, and historical practice. A particular focus of study was the modes in which memory is organized, whether oral, corporeal, or institutional.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise 1994-1995 recordings of the seminar "Imaging the City in the Americas."  According to director Thomas F. Reese, the "research focus of the seminar is to consider how the image of the American city came into being and how it functioned in the construction of civic identities.  In a multidisciplinary and comparative approach to the subject, and within the context of social, political, and economic conditions of urbanization, the seminar focuses on selected cities that experienced rapid demographic change and economic expansion in the early 20th century, in order to examine the relationship between the politics of their development and their visual representation in popular culture, art, and literature.  The objective is to illuminate not only the means by which ideas and images of urban form were constructed for, as well as by, various urban constituencies, but also the full range of modernist technologies that were harnessed for these purposes."</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise recordings of a series of readings, interviews, and discussions based on the theme, "Imaging the Us." Some of the events in the series were held at the Los Angeles Central Library in April of 1995 and included participants Quincy Troupe, Dorothy Allison, Isaac Julien, Gioconda Belli, Anchee Min, and Greg Sarris, who read from their own autobiographical works and discussed the relationships among autobiographical writing, memory, and the articulation of an "Us." The second aspect of the series was a sequence of radio interviews/discussions with authors hosted by Michael Silverblatt on KCRW.  This series of radio interviews, a collaboration between Bookworm and the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, centered around autobiography and collective memory within the "Imaging the Us" theme.</p>

                     <p>The audio recordings capture lectures presented by Carlo Ginzburg in the spring of 1995 as he discusses the concept of "Making Things Strange." Ginzburg suggests that gaining perspective on some works of art is best achieved by distancing oneself from the work, and that this type of estrangement is a literary device with its own unique history.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1994/1995 that were not part of larger symposia or series within that year.  For the 1994/1995 year, invitations were extended to a broad range of scholars whose work explored the subject of memory as a psychological, cultural, and historical practice. A particular focus of study was the modes in which memory is organized, whether oral, corporeal, or institutional.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1995/1996.  During this time Getty scholars explored the theme "The Nature and Idea of Collecting" as a topic broadly defined to include: the social and institutional practice of collecting; how it reflects the values of a given community, region, and era; systems of display and classification; and the emergence of new languages and classes of collecting. Among the areas studied by this year's Getty Scholars were the collecting practices of Renaissance Italy, the dispersal of the art collections of Great Britain after the Civil Wars of 1640, and the social function of collecting in Oceanic cultures.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1995/1996.  During this time Getty scholars explored the theme "The Nature and Idea of Collecting" as a topic broadly defined to include: the social and institutional practice of collecting; how it reflects the values of a given community, region, and era; systems of display and classification; and the emergence of new languages and classes of collecting. Among the areas studied by this year's Getty Scholars were the collecting practices of Renaissance Italy, the dispersal of the art collections of Great Britain after the Civil Wars of 1640, and the social function of collecting in Oceanic cultures.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1996/1997.  During this time Getty scholars explored the theme <emph render="italic">Perspectives on Los Angeles: Narratives, Images, History,</emph> which was devoted to research on Los Angeles and to comparative projects that viewed the city in relationship to other hemispheric and global sites. Scholars in residence had the opportunity to participate in a number of corollary programs developed by the Research Institute on issues of identity, community, and public culture, as well as programs having to do with preservation, resource development, and the comparative study of cities in the Americas at the turn of the century. A series of lectures was also presented in anticipation of the J. Paul Getty Museum's 1999 exhibition "Dosso Dossi, Court Painter in Renaissance Ferrara."</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1996/1997.  During this time Getty scholars explored the theme <emph render="italic">Perspectives on Los Angeles: Narratives, Images, History,</emph> which was devoted to research on Los Angeles and to comparative projects that viewed the city in relationship to other hemispheric and global sites. Scholars in residence had the opportunity to participate in a number of corollary programs developed by the Research Institute on issues of identity, community, and public culture, as well as programs having to do with preservation, resource development, and the comparative study of cities in the Americas at the turn of the century.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar years 1997/1998 and 1998/1999.  During this time Getty scholars explored the theme of the residential scholar program <emph render="italic">Representing the Passions</emph> and studied the ways in which strong, ungovernable emotions have been represented and classified in the arts throughout the history of the arts and humanities. This theme focused on the social need to name the passions (thus distinguishing them from one another) and to develop gestural and rhetorical conventions and codes in reference to them, while simultaneously noting how the ungovernability of the passions threatens either to break through or to be lost by the cultural conventions and codes that attempt to ritualize and control them. Theorists of human nature, language, and politics have wrestled with the challenge of the ungovernability of the passions since antiquity and the challenge continues to confront contemporary painters, actors, writers, and musicians.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of lectures from a 1998 Getty Research Institute conference titled "Interpreting El Lissitzky: New Perspectives." In these lectures an international group of scholars examine works by El Lissitzky, one of the most influential artists of the early 20th-century Russian avant-garde. Scholars discuss his book designs, demonstration spaces, photographs, and the propaganda billboard, in order to assess the importance of underlying threads that hold his diverse career together.  The conference was held in conjunction with the Getty's exhibition, <emph render="italic">"Monuments of the Future": Designs by El Lissitzky</emph>, which opened in November, 1998.</p>

                     <p>Materials comprise audio recordings of the 1999 symposium "Mapping L.A.: A Global Prototype," which was designed to spotlight the archives of Southern California and celebrate the publication: "Cultural Inheritance LA: A Directory of Less-Visible Archives and Collections in the Los Angeles Region."  The symposium was part of the L.A. as Subject collaboration.  The first day of the symposium was by invitation only and had a scholarly and theoretical focus.  Day One featured keynote speaker Angela Oh and included a videoconference panel discussion with Prague regarding the Stories Exchange Project. The second day was open to the public and featured professional archivists, curators, and historians who shared information about preserving and displaying collections.  Day Two speakers included Janet Fireman, Robert Gottlieb, Ruben Martinez and others.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 1999/2000.  During this time Getty scholars explored the theme <emph render="italic">Humanities in Comparative, Historical Perspective.</emph>  Scholars studied how the humanities had developed as a cultural category in the United States and what work was done (or avoided) by this categorization. They were particularly interested in the relation of the history of art to other fields of humanistic study. How had these fields developed in relation to the arts, and how were contemporary artistic practices being informed by and making contributions to these fields? They were also interested in the connections between the humanities and other areas of culture, including the sciences, popular culture, and religion. How had the identity of the humanities developed in relation and contradistinction to these other areas, and what productive connections could be developed between them? Their approach to these issues was largely comparative and historical. That is, they explored how cultural categories analogous to "humanities" (<emph render="italic">sciences humaines</emph> and <emph render="italic">Geisteswissenschaften,</emph> for example) had developed in diverse contexts around the world and examined the different kinds of cultural work in these categories.</p>

                  <p>Materials comprise recordings of events, lectures, and discussions held at the Getty during the scholar year 2000/2001.  During this time Getty Scholars explored the theme <emph render="italic">Reproductions and originals</emph>. Of interest during this scholar year were such issues as the often fugitive nature of reproductive media; the ambiguous status of reproductions as "realistic" representations or decontextualized fragments; the use of reproductions in defining intellectual categories and developing object taxonomies; the pedagogical applications of visual archives; asymmetries between direct observation, textual description, and illustration; and the roles of reproductive images in establishing, sustaining, recovering, and replacing cultural memory. Of interest also were questions stemming from any number of relevant subjects, from ekphrasis to conceptual art, from Cassiano Dal Pozzo's Paper Museum to quotation practices by postmodern artists, from tapestry production in the Old Regime to Chinese literati painting and calligraphy in the manner of revered masters. The words used to address subjects such as these led to controversial questions about authenticity and creativity of import to scholars from across the humanities.</p>

               <p>This collection consists of photographs taken by Pamela Blackwell, Robert Walker, and other photographers, 1985-2007, for the Getty Scholar Program. The photographs are 35mm or larger 1 1/2" by 2 1/4" negatives, slides, contact sheets, or 8"x10" or 11"x14" oversize photographic prints. The black-and-white photographs of Getty scholars were used to select official scholar portraits. Official black-and-white portraits were also selectively taken of guest scholars, pre-doctoral fellows, post-doctoral fellows, and occassionally research associates. Other photographs document scholar activities including tours, symposia, receptions, and other events. Occasional photographs of program staff are also included.</p>
