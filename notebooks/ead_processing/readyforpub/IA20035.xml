         <p>This collection consists of audiovisual recordings of public programming events sponsored by the J. Paul Getty Museum that were held at the Getty Villa campus from 2006 to 2018. Related ephemera is present for select events dated from 2006 to 2013.</p>
         <p>Events comprise scholarly lectures, seminars, workshops, colloquia, and symposia conducted by experts in their particular fields. The collection represents the forefront of academic thought on such matters as ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria. Events also present complementary themes related to current Getty exhibitions, initiatives, and the permanent collection, as well as interdisciplinary topics related to the activities of the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Research Institute, the Getty Conservation Institute, and the Getty Foundation. </p>
         <p>Events were organized by the Museum's department of Public Programs at the Getty Villa. Recordings include born-digital files stored on CDs, DVDs, and Getty servers. Ephemera may include the following: event programs or schedules, abstracts of lectures, or brief biographies of participants. Select events include links to webcasts available on getty.edu.</p>

         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>The Getty Villa, located just off the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades, California, operates as a museum and educational center dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria. The Getty Villa was designed to house J. Paul Getty's art collection when it outgrew his Ranch House, which had served as a private museum since 1954. After considering various options for expanding the Ranch House, Getty decided in the fall of 1968 to build a new museum on the same property, in the form of a first-century Roman country house, based primarily on the plans of the ancient Villa dei Papiri just outside of Herculaneum. The archaeologist Norman Neuerburg, who had studied the ruins of Herculaneum and was an authority on Roman domestic architecture, was retained as a consultant for the project. The Santa Monica architectural firm Langdon and Wilson was hired to design the Villa, and British architect Stephen Garrett, who had served as Getty's consultant in the remodeling of a Getty home in Posillipo, Italy, was retained as overseer of the construction.  Landscape architect Emmet Wemple designed the gardens, artist Garth Benton painted the murals, and consultant Bruce Ptolemy designed the fountains. The construction itself was done by Dinwiddie Construction Co., with various subcontractors.  Construction began on December 21, 1970, and the new museum opened to the public on January 16, 1974. </p>
         <p>As part of the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Villa is overseen by the J. Paul Getty Trust, an international cultural and philanthropic organization serving both general audiences and specialized professionals. The Trust is a not-for-profit institution, educational in purpose and character, that focuses on the visual arts in all of their dimensions. As of 2019 the Trust supports and oversees four programs: the Getty Research Institute, the Getty Foundation, the Getty Conservation Institute, and the J. Paul Getty Museum.  Beginning in the 1980s the Trust developed an expansion plan that included the Getty Center campus in Brentwood and the renovation and expansion of the Villa in Pacific Palisades.  When the Getty Center opened in 1997, the Villa closed to undergo extensive remodeling.  The architectural firm of Machado and Silvetti Associates redesigned the Villa, and it reopened on January 28, 2006. While most of the Museum's collections are housed at the Getty Center, the antiquities collection is housed at the Villa.  The Getty Villa serves a varied audience through the permanent collection, changing exhibitions, conservation, scholarship, research, and public programs in an intimate setting overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  A reinstallation of the permanent collections began in 2017; the new, chronological presentation was opened to the public on April 18, 2018. </p>
         <p>The history of public programming at the Getty dates to the Museum's earliest years, with public lectures regularly held at the Ranch House and the Getty Villa. The Museum offered a limited selection of
other public events, including theatrical productions and music performances. The opening of the Getty Center in 1997 initiated a wide-sweeping, programmatic effort to integrate public events with the museum-going experience.</p>
         <p>With the goal of broadening the Museum's audience, the institution developed a number of ongoing series, as well as regularly scheduled individual events, focusing on scholarly topics, gallery tours,
and the performing arts. Series launched in 1998 that continue at the Getty Center include <emph render="italic">Sounds of L.A.</emph>, <emph render="italic">Selected Shorts</emph>, <emph render="italic">Friday Nights at the Getty</emph> (which have since moved to Saturdays), and the <emph render="italic">Gordon Getty Concerts</emph>, named in honor of J. Paul Getty's son and former Trustee Gordon Getty. Since the reopening of the Villa in 2006, visitors have had the opportunity to enjoy theatrical performances in the classical tradition at the Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman Outdoor Classical Theater. As of 2019, the Museum offers a variety of events for children and adults, including artist projects, demonstrations, courses, tours, lectures, symposia, and a host of performances at both the Getty Center and Getty Villa.</p>
         <p>Public Programming responsiblities were historically undertaken by the Museum's Education Department, with a designated Performing Arts Manager joining the Getty in 1999. In 2001, the performing arts program moved to the renamed Exhibitions and Public Programs Department; by 2008, it had returned to the auspices of the Education Department. In 2016, Public Programs became a department within the newly expanded division of Education, Public Programs, and Interpretive Media
(renamed Interpretive Content in 2018).</p>
