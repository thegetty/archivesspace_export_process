         <head>Administrative History</head>
         <p>The Getty Villa operates as a museum and educational center dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria.   The Getty Villa was designed to house J. Paul Getty's art collection when it outgrew his Ranch House in Pacific Palisades, California, which had served as a private museum since 1954. After considering various options for expanding the Ranch House, Getty decided in the fall of 1968 to build a new museum on the same property, in the form of a first-century Roman country house, based primarily on the plans of the ancient Villa dei Papiri just outside of Herculaneum. The archaeologist Norman Neuerburg, who had studied the ruins of Herculaneum and was an authority on Roman domestic architecture, was retained as a consultant for the project. The Santa Monica architectural firm Langdon &amp; Wilson was hired to design the Villa, and British architect Stephen Garrett, who had served as Getty's consultant in the remodeling of a Getty home in Posillipo, Italy, was retained as overseer of the construction.  Landscape architect Emmet Wemple designed the gardens, Garth Benton worked on the murals, and Bruce Ptolomy worked on the fountains.  Construction began on December 21, 1970, and the new museum opened to the public on January 16, 1974, receiving negative and positive reviews. </p>
         <p>J. Paul Getty died in 1976 without ever seeing the museum he commissioned, but is buried at the Villa site on a bluff overlooking the ocean.  After Getty's death and the establishment of the J. Paul Getty Trust, the Villa became part of a larger vision.  As part of the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Villa is overseen by the J. Paul Getty Trust, an international cultural and philanthropic organization serving both general audiences and specialized professionals. The Trust is a not-for-profit institution, educational in purpose and character, that focuses on the visual arts in all of their dimensions. As of 2009 the Trust supports and oversees four programs: the Getty Research Institute; the Getty Foundation; the Getty Conservation Institute; and the J. Paul Getty Museum.  Beginning in the 1980s the Trust developed an expansion plan that included the Getty Center campus in Brentwood and the renovation and expansion of the Villa in Malibu.  When the Getty Center opened in 1997, the Villa closed to undergo extensive remodeling.  </p>
         <p>The architectural firm of Machado and Silvetti Associates redesigned the Villa, adding galleries, skylights, an auditorium, an amphitheater, and new structures for conservation and administrative offices. Much of the original Villa was retained, including the wall murals, which artist Garth Benton returned to restore and refresh.  The redesigned Villa opened on January 28, 2006, receiving high praise from reviewers. While most of the Museum's collections are housed at the Getty Center, the antiquities collection is housed at the Villa.  The Getty Villa serves a varied audience through the permanent collection, changing exhibitions, conservation, scholarship, research, and public programs in an intimate setting overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  Public and scholarly programs at the Villa include lectures, seminars, conferences, workshops, symposia, film series, musical concerts, and theatrical performances in the Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman Outdoor Classical Theater.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
         <p>Photographs consist of 45 black and white and 66 color prints of the recently expanded and renovated Getty Villa in Malibu, taken by photographer Julius Shulman in May and June, 2006. Shulman previously photographed the Villa in the 1970s and 1980s and these 2006 photos constitute a valuable supplement to those earlier images. These pictures, taken on Tuesdays when the museum was closed, were commissioned by the Communications Department of the J. Paul Getty Trust. </p>
         <p>A partial set of 29 duplicates of the color prints are also included, as well as the original 4x5 negatives for those prints.</p>
         <p>The photographs were taken with the collaboration of Jürgen Nogai, a German photographer living in Santa Monica, and Shulman's collaborator since 2000. </p>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Photographer Julius Shulman was renowned for his striking images of modern architecture.  He was born October 10, 1910 in Brooklyn, New York, and moved to Los Angeles, California in 1920. Throughout the 1930s, Shulman photographed historical locations in Los Angeles, and his real break occurred in 1936, when he photographed architect Richard J. Neutra's Kun House (Los Angeles, Calif.). He was subsequently asked by Neutra to photograph some of his other projects. Through his relationship with Neutra he was able to secure other architectural photography commissions, documenting the work of architects as R.M. Schindler, Raphael Soriano, Gregory Ain, J.R. Davidson, John Lautner and Pierre Koenig as well as many others. While he also shot product and furniture photographs for designers, he is most acclaimed for his iconic images of mid-century modern buildings including the Case Study houses of Southern California. Shulman's photographs have been widely published, and he has produced several monographs about his work, including: <emph render="italic">Photography of Architecture and Design: Photographing Buildings, Interiors, and the Visual Arts</emph> (1977), <emph render="italic">Architecture and its Photography</emph> (1998), <emph render="italic">Photographing Architecture and Interiors</emph> (2000), and <emph render="italic">Malibu: A Century of Living by the Sea</emph> (2005). </p>
         <p>Over the years Shulman became known as a strong proponent of modernist architecture and his photographs trained the spotlight on the architects whose work he featured.  He received the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Architectural Photography Medal in 1969 and was made an honorary member of the AIA in 1987. In 1987 the L.A. Cultural Heritage Commission designated Shulman's Hollywood Hills home as a monument because it is the last unaltered steel-frame structure designed by Soriano.  After a brief retirement in 1986, Shulman returned to work as a photographer and accepted assignments well into the 21st century. Julius Shulman died in his home at the age of 98 on July 15, 2009.</p>

In most cases, item numbers for photographs in the respective sets match: for example, 8048-1K features the same subject and composition as 8048-1. Images that have negatives and duplicates available in the archives are noted.</p>
